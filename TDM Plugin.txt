Survivors are able to respawn. The very basic fundamental command of TDM has been nailed. This gamemode is based on Versus.

Now its just additions from here on in. Additions include:

Special Infected claw damage adjustment. (done)
KillTracking. (done)
Time limit on maps (may have to pause the map for that)
Different respawn locations for survivors.
Weapon choice. (Use menus) (somewhat done)
Kill rewards.
Choice of Friendly fire on or off. (somewhat done, infected need to be done too)

Kill rewards:

Survivors:

Get a random item after 3 kills

Access to Tier 2 weapons after 5 kills

Access to Tier 3 weapons after 7 kills

Infected:

Call in a horde after 3 kills

Call in a witch after 5 kills

Play as a tank after 7 kills


Things to find out in coding:

How do you put a userid onto an entity?

How do you transfer a string to a function?

Kill Rewards questions:

Should they be accessible via menu? Or should the rewards automatically take effect?
